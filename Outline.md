        - Bounds (NG)
            - total size, # of messages, etc.
            - Behavior on boundary condition
                - Notification behavior
                    - Send "full" replies for new messages?
                    - Broadcast "full" events?
                - Action:
                    - Drop new (tail) messages
                    - Drop old (head) messages
                    - Crash
                    - Block incoming new messages??
        - Batching
            - Time and/or message count: if both, whichever comes first
        - Recovery behavior: start accepting new msgs first, or fully recover first?
    - Interface
        - Event: onEmpty
        - Event: onNewMessage (persist)
        - Event: onStart (do recovery behavior)

- Replies
    - None (broadcast)
    - Reply on receipt/parse (no persistence, not that useful)
    - Persistence only
    - Processing only
        - What happens if sender goes away (reboot, etc) after persistence but before processing.
    - Hybrid (with timeout) replies:
        - PERSISTED (processing did not start before timeout)
        - STARTED (processing started but did not finish before timeout)
        - FINISHED (processing finished before timeout)
- Processors (persistence and runners)
